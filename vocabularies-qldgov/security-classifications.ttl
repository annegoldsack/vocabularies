PROTECTED information assets require a substantial degree of control as compromise could cause serious damage to the State, the Government, commercial entities or members of the public. PROTECTED information must be labelled. Cabinet information is PROTECTED. Cabinet documents (CABINET information) can be damaging to the public policy agenda and the government generally, and to the public interest. Unlawful disclosure of Cabinet information may constitute an offence under the Criminal Code Act 1899 (Qld), Public Sector Ethics Act 1994 (Qld) and may constitute official misconduct under the Crime and Misconduct Act 2001 (Qld). The primary guidance document to support these processes, including the handling of Cabinet material, is the Queensland Cabinet Handbook. Most PROTECTED information is subject the Public Records Act 2002 (Qld)."@en ;

OFFICIAL information is routine information without special sensitivity or handling requirements. All routine public-sector business, operations and services is treated as OFFICIAL.
